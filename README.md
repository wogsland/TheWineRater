# The Wine Rater

This is a website with information about wine. It was created with a PERL script acting on a CSV.

## Development Plan, or Lies

v1.0 is hardcoded in html and poorly monetized with ads. And by poorly I mean they're there but they make no money.

Future Plans:

v1.1 will implement structural changes:
mySQL backend,
PHP codeignigtor framework,
images outside the directory structure of code ignitor controllers

v1.2 will add users:
login,
user pages,
rating of wines,
superusers can add wines

v1.3 will concern a revenue model.
